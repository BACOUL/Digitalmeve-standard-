# ADR-0005: Governance of the DigitalMeve Standard

## Status
Accepted

## Context
DigitalMeve aims to become a **global standard** for invisible certification embedded into documents and files.  
For long-term adoption, credibility, and interoperability, the standard requires a clear **governance model**.  

Without governance:
- Developers and companies would hesitate to adopt, fearing instability.
- Competing or forked implementations could fragment the ecosystem.
- Legal and institutional stakeholders would lack trust in the durability of the standard.

We looked at existing models:
- **IETF RFCs** → open process, wide adoption, but sometimes slow.
- **W3C** → strong formalism, industry-driven, good for interoperability.
- **Linux Foundation projects** → neutral ground, strong brand, collaborative development.
- **Proprietary control** → faster, but weak adoption and lack of global trust.

## Decision
DigitalMeve adopts a **transparent, hybrid governance model**:
1. **Neutrality** — The specification (.MEVE) is **open, free to use, and documented** in this repository.  
2. **Decision Process** — All significant changes are recorded via **ADRs** (Architecture Decision Records).  
3. **Community Input** — Issues and pull requests are open to anyone; feedback is reviewed systematically.  
4. **Stewardship** — A **Technical Steering Committee (TSC)** is created to review and accept/reject ADRs.  
5. **Versioning** — Semantic versioning (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`) ensures stability.  
6. **Transparency** — Roadmap, ADRs, and governance rules are always public in the GitHub repo.  
7. **Adoption Path** — Contributions from enterprises, governments, and academia are welcome under clear contribution guidelines.

This model ensures:
- **Credibility** → trusted by developers, enterprises, and institutions.  
- **Agility** → decisions are recorded, not improvised.  
- **Durability** → the standard is independent of any single company.  

## Alternatives Considered
- **Closed proprietary model**  
  - ✅ Faster innovation.  
  - ❌ Low adoption, no trust, vendor lock-in → rejected.  

- **Pure community-driven (no formal TSC)**  
  - ✅ Open and democratic.  
  - ❌ Risk of fragmentation, slow or inconsistent decisions → rejected.  

- **Single foundation control (e.g., W3C-only)**  
  - ✅ Global recognition.  
  - ❌ Too rigid for early-stage innovation → rejected.  

## Consequences
- DigitalMeve is **recognized as an open global standard**, while keeping flexibility.  
- Every future technical or strategic choice must be backed by an ADR.  
- External stakeholders (partners, governments, enterprises) can safely adopt the standard, knowing it is **transparent, open, and durable**.
