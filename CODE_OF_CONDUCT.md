# Code of Conduct — DigitalMeve

## Our Pledge
We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in the DigitalMeve ecosystem a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, experience level, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:
- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best for the community, the standard, and its users

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others’ private information (such as a physical or email address) without their explicit permission
- Violence, threats of violence, or encouragement of self-harm
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Project maintainers and the Technical Steering Committee (TSC) are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior.  
They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct; they will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies:
- Within all community spaces (repositories, issues, discussions, ADR reviews, documentation, events), and
- When an individual is officially representing the project or its community (including using an official email address, posting via official social channels, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event).

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by:
- Emailing **conduct@digitalmeve.org**
- Opening a **private report** via GitHub (Security/Abuse report) if email is not possible

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.  
The project team will respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

**Conflicts of interest**: If the reported incident involves someone on the enforcement team, that person will be recused from handling the incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines
Community leaders will follow these guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction
**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome but with limited impact.  
**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity about the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning
**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.  
**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban
**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.  
**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban
**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.  
**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.
