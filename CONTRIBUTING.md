## 3. Getting Started
- Fork the repository and clone your fork locally.
- Install dependencies (if any) as described in `README.md`.
- Familiarize yourself with the [STANDARD.md](STANDARD.md) and [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).
- All contributions should align with the philosophy of **privacy-first, interoperability, and open standardization**.

---

## 4. Development Workflow
1. **Branching**
   - Create a feature branch:  
     `git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature`
   - Use descriptive names (e.g., `fix/sha256-validation`, `docs/add-pricing`).

2. **Commits**
   - Write clear, atomic commits.
   - Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) spec (e.g., `feat: add DNS binding support`).

3. **Tests**
   - Provide tests or examples whenever relevant.
   - Ensure nothing sensitive (like private keys) is committed.

4. **Linting & CI**
   - Code should pass linting rules.
   - PRs must pass automated checks before merging.

---

## 5. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
All significant technical or governance decisions must be documented as **ADRs** under `/ADRs`.

- Use the template: `ADR-0001-template.md`
- Include: context, decision, rationale, alternatives considered, consequences.
- Every PR that changes the standard requires at least one ADR entry.

---

## 6. Pull Request Process
- Ensure PRs are **focused and minimal**. One feature/fix per PR.
- Reference the related issue (e.g., `Closes #42`).
- Update documentation (README, STANDARD, FAQ, etc.) if needed.
- PRs require at least **one approval** from a maintainer before merging.
- Security-related changes require a **mandatory audit**.

---

## 7. Issue Reporting
When reporting an issue:

- Use the provided issue templates (`bug_report.md`, `spec_change_request.md`).
- Provide a clear title and detailed description.
- Include steps to reproduce (for bugs).
- Suggest potential solutions if possible.
- Avoid disclosing vulnerabilities publicly ‚Äî see [Security](#security-and-responsible-disclosure).

---

## 8. Style Guides
- **Documentation** ‚Üí Use clear, professional English. Prefer Markdown with headings, lists, and code blocks.
- **Diagrams** ‚Üí Place in `/diagrams` (SVG or PNG, no proprietary formats).
- **Examples** ‚Üí Place in `/examples` with descriptive filenames.
- **Commit messages** ‚Üí Use imperative mood (‚Äúadd feature‚Äù, not ‚Äúadded feature‚Äù).
- **Code style** ‚Üí Follow language-specific best practices.

---

## 9. Security and Responsible Disclosure
If you discover a vulnerability:

1. **Do not open a public issue.**
2. Report privately via [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
3. Provide as much detail as possible for reproduction.
4. We will acknowledge receipt within **48h** and aim to provide a fix or mitigation timeline.

We value security researchers and will credit contributions where appropriate.
