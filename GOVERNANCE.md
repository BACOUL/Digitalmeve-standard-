# Governance of DigitalMeve

DigitalMeve is designed not only as a product, but as a **global standard for digital certification**.  
To ensure neutrality, transparency, and long-term adoption, this document defines the governance model of the project.

---

## 1. Mission of Governance
The governance of DigitalMeve ensures that:
- The standard remains **simple, secure, and universal**.  
- Decisions are made **transparently and openly**.  
- The protocol evolves **without breaking compatibility**.  
- Adoption is fostered among **individuals, professionals, and institutions worldwide**.  

---

## 2. Core Principles
- **Neutrality** → No single actor (company, government, or individual) can unilaterally change the standard.  
- **Transparency** → Every change must be documented in an **ADR (Architecture Decision Record)**.  
- **Openness** → All discussions and specifications are public and open for contribution.  
- **Permanence** → DigitalMeve commits to long-term support and backward compatibility.  

---

## 3. Decision-Making Process
- **Minor changes** (typos, formatting, clarifications) can be merged directly by maintainers.  
- **Technical changes** must be proposed via:
  1. An **Issue** on GitHub describing the motivation.  
  2. A **Pull Request** including a new ADR in `/ADRs/`.  
- **Major changes** (cryptography primitives, file structure, certificate schema) require:  
  - Community discussion (GitHub Issues + forums).  
  - Review by maintainers and experts.  
  - Consensus before merging.  

---

## 4. Versioning Policy (SemVer)
DigitalMeve follows **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)**:

- **v1.x** → Core features (file watermark, SHA-256 invisible proof, invisible DigitalMeve key, HTML certificates).  
- **v2.x** → Professional features (private keys for companies, DNS integration, APIs, advanced verification tools).  
- **v3.x and beyond** → Institutional adoption, multi-format compatibility, international standardization (ISO, W3C, IETF).  

Each release must include:
- A **changelog** in `ROADMAP.md`.  
- Migration guides when breaking changes occur.  

---

## 5. Roles and Responsibilities
- **Maintainers**:  
  - Manage Pull Requests and releases.  
  - Ensure alignment with governance principles.  
- **Contributors**:  
  - Anyone can propose changes, improvements, or bug reports.  
  - Contributions must follow `CONTRIBUTING.md`.  
- **Advisory Board (future stage)**:  
  - Composed of institutions, companies, and cryptography experts.  
  - Validates strategic decisions and ensures neutrality.  

---

## 6. Alignment with Global Standards
To achieve credibility as a **worldwide certification protocol**, DigitalMeve aligns with:  
- **ISO/IEC** standards (information security, digital trust).  
- **W3C** (web interoperability and cryptographic APIs).  
- **IETF** (open internet protocols).  
- **EU & US regulations** (GDPR, eIDAS, NIST guidelines).  

---

## 7. Governance Evolution
- This governance document is reviewed **annually**.  
- Community proposals can suggest governance changes via an ADR.  
- Governance maturity evolves with adoption:  
  - **Phase 1 (Founders-led)**: Initial design and bootstrap.  
  - **Phase 2 (Community-driven)**: Contributors + maintainers share decision-making.  
  - **Phase 3 (Institutional standard)**: Governance includes independent organizations and regulators.  

---

## 8. Audits and Trust
- **Independent audits** will be conducted periodically (cryptography, data protection, security model).  
- Results will be **published openly**.  
- Any vulnerability disclosure follows the `SECURITY.md` policy.  

---

## 9. Long-Term Vision
The ultimate goal is for **DigitalMeve certificates** to become as recognized and reliable as existing global standards (PDF, SSL/TLS, DNSSEC).  

- Individuals: accessible, trustworthy certification for personal files.  
- Professionals: integration into workflows, APIs, and business processes.  
- Institutions: adoption as a **recognized standard for digital trust**.  

---

## 10. Contact and Participation
- Governance discussions are public in the [GitHub Issues](./issues).  
- Contributions must follow [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).  
- Formal proposals must be submitted as **ADRs**.
