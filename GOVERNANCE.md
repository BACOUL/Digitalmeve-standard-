# Governance — DigitalMeve Standard

## 1. Purpose

The DigitalMeve standard defines how **invisible proofs and certifications** are embedded and verified in digital files.  
Because it aspires to become a **global standard**, its governance must be **transparent, inclusive, and technically rigorous**.

This document sets out the rules for how the standard evolves.

---

## 2. Principles

DigitalMeve governance follows these guiding principles:

1. **Openness** — All specifications, discussions, and decisions are public.  
2. **Neutrality** — No single company owns the standard; it is community-driven.  
3. **Interoperability** — Implementations must remain compatible across platforms and vendors.  
4. **Backward compatibility** — Existing certificates remain valid indefinitely.  
5. **Transparency** — Every design decision is documented (ADR model).  
6. **Security-first** — Any change must maintain or improve cryptographic and privacy guarantees.

## 3. Versioning Policy

- We follow **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)**:
  - **MAJOR** (X.0.0): breaking changes, e.g., new cryptographic primitives.  
  - **MINOR** (0.Y.0): new features, backward-compatible.  
  - **PATCH** (0.0.Z): bug fixes, clarifications.  

- Certificates generated with older versions must remain **verifiable forever**.  
- Deprecations require **at least 24 months of transition** before removal.

## 4. Decision Process

### 4.1 Proposals
- Changes are proposed via **GitHub Pull Requests**.  
- Each proposal must include an **ADR (Architecture Decision Record)**.  
- ADRs explain the problem, alternatives, decision, and consequences.  

### 4.2 Review
- PRs are reviewed by **Maintainers** (see section 5).  
- Public discussion is encouraged before merging.  

### 4.3 Voting
- For breaking changes (MAJOR), a **supermajority (≥ 75%) of maintainers** must approve.  
- For MINOR or PATCH, **simple majority (≥ 50%)** is sufficient.  

### 4.4 Transparency
- All accepted/rejected ADRs are stored in the `/ADRs` directory.  
- A public changelog is maintained in `ROADMAP.md`.

## 5. Roles & Responsibilities

- **Contributors**  
  Anyone can open issues, submit PRs, or suggest improvements.  

- **Maintainers**  
  Trusted developers with write access to the repository.  
  They ensure consistency, security, and alignment with governance rules.  

- **Advisory Board**  
  Representatives from academia, industry, and open-source.  
  They provide **non-binding recommendations** for major evolutions.  

- **Enterprises & Partners**  
  Enterprises using DigitalMeve Pro may request feature extensions.  
  Requests follow the same open ADR process.  

---

## 6. Conflict Resolution

- Minor conflicts are resolved through GitHub discussion.  
- Persistent disagreements trigger a **vote among maintainers**.  
- If unresolved, the issue is escalated to the **Advisory Board**.  

---

## 7. Security Governance

- Any change affecting cryptography or proofs requires a **formal audit** before release.  
- Emergency security patches bypass normal ADR but require **post-mortem ADR** after deployment.  
- The **Security Team** maintains `SECURITY.md` and coordinates responsible disclosure.  

---

## 8. Standard Evolution

The standard evolves through **phased releases**:

- **v1.x**: Core proof embedding (watermark + invisible SHA-256 + invisible DigitalMeve key).  
- **v2.x**: Professional keys, enterprise integration (DNS binding, HSM support).  
- **v3.x**: Post-quantum signatures, zero-knowledge selective disclosure.  

Each phase is documented in `ROADMAP.md`.

---

## 9. Transparency & Audits

- All source code and specifications are public under an open license.  
- Independent **third-party audits** will be published annually.  
- DigitalMeve commits to **transparency reports** (government requests, vulnerabilities fixed).  

---

## 10. Amendments to Governance

- Governance changes follow the same ADR process.  
- A **supermajority (≥ 75%) of maintainers** is required.  
- Changes must be announced with **30 days’ public review period** before adoption.
