# ⚖️ Governance — DigitalMeve

DigitalMeve is an **open standard**. Its governance ensures **stability, transparency, and trust** while allowing innovation.  
This document defines the roles, decision-making process, and long-term evolution of the project.

---

## 🎯 Principles
1. **Transparency** — All changes are public (GitHub Issues, Pull Requests, ADRs).
2. **Stability** — Backward compatibility is preserved unless a major version is released.
3. **Security-first** — Cryptographic and compliance updates require independent reviews.
4. **Open Participation** — Anyone can contribute; decisions are based on merit and evidence.
5. **Global Alignment** — Roadmap aligns with ISO, W3C, and international data-protection laws.

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Roles
- **Maintainers**  
  - Core team responsible for reviewing and merging contributions.  
  - Guarantee consistency with the DigitalMeve mission.  

- **Contributors**  
  - Anyone submitting Issues, Pull Requests, or ADRs.  
  - Encouraged to propose improvements and report vulnerabilities.  

- **Advisors**  
  - Experts in cryptography, compliance, or governance providing external reviews.  
  - Participate in audits and roadmap validation.  

---

## 🔄 Decision-Making
- **Minor changes** (typos, formatting, docs) → Direct merge by maintainers.  
- **Technical changes** (features, architecture, APIs) → Require an **ADR (Architecture Decision Record)**.  
- **Breaking changes** (security model, certificate format, `.meve` container) →  
  - Public discussion in Issues.  
  - Review by at least 2 maintainers.  
  - External expert review if security-related.  
  - Final decision documented in ADRs.  

---

## 🗂 Governance Artifacts
- **/ADRs/** — Architecture Decision Records (one file per decision).  
- **/ROADMAP.md** — Official evolution path (living document).  
- **/SECURITY_MODEL.md** — Cryptographic and compliance guarantees.  
- **/GOVERNANCE.md** — This document (process and rules).  

---

## 📅 Versioning
- **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)** is applied:  
  - `MAJOR` — Breaking changes.  
  - `MINOR` — New features, backward compatible.  
  - `PATCH` — Fixes, improvements, docs.  
- **Certificate format** follows the same rules:  
  - v1.x — Watermark + invisible proofs.  
  - v2.x — Enterprise keys + DNS.  
  - v3.x — `.meve` container.

---

## 🔐 Security Governance
- **Vulnerability Disclosure** — via [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md).  
- **Audits** — All major cryptographic changes require an independent audit.  
- **Patch Policy** — Critical security issues patched within **72 hours**.  
- **Transparency Log** — All security-related ADRs are logged for auditability.  

---

## 🌍 Global Governance Roadmap
- **Phase 1 (2025–2026)** — Maintainers-led governance.  
- **Phase 2 (2027–2028)** — Advisory board with external experts.  
- **Phase 3 (2029+)** — Formal standardization (ISO / W3C).  

---

## 🤝 Community Participation
- **Issues** → Suggest improvements, ask questions, report bugs.  
- **Pull Requests** → Contribute code, documentation, or tests.  
- **ADRs** → Propose major architectural changes.  
- **Working Groups** → Temporary groups for roadmap initiatives (e.g., `.meve` format).

## 🧭 Governance Review
- Governance rules are reviewed **annually**.  
- Updates require an ADR and at least **two maintainer approvals**.  
- Major changes are announced publicly before enforcement.
