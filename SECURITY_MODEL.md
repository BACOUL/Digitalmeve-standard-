# DigitalMeve Security Model

**Invisible proof. Visible trust.**  
This document defines the **security principles**, **threat model**, and **compliance requirements** of the DigitalMeve Standard (DMS).  
It ensures that all certified files remain **authentic, private, and verifiable** over time.

## 1. Principles
- **Zero trust in servers** → All operations (generation & verification) are performed in the user’s browser.  
- **Defense in depth** → Multiple layers: visible watermark, SHA-256 hash, invisible DigitalMeve key, private keys.  
- **Privacy-first** → Files are never uploaded, stored, or shared.  
- **Transparency** → Certificates are open, auditable, and interoperable.  
- **Longevity** → Certificates remain valid across formats, devices, and future cryptographic evolutions.  

---

## 2. Threat Model
DigitalMeve defends against:  
- **File tampering** → Malicious modifications or undetected edits.  
- **Forgery attempts** → Creating fake certificates or cloned files.  
- **Replay attacks** → Reusing an old certificate for a different file.  
- **Phishing or impersonation** → Using fake certificates to trick users.  
- **Enterprise risks** → Identity theft, DNS spoofing, private key misuse.  

Not in scope:  
- Protecting file **content secrecy** (encryption is external).  
- Preventing redistribution of already certified files.  

---

## 3. Security Layers
Every certified file includes:  
- ✅ **Visible watermark** → Immediate human validation.  
- ✅ **SHA-256 integrity hash** → Cryptographic protection against tampering.  
- ✅ **Invisible DigitalMeve key** → Proprietary, invisible marker to guarantee authenticity.  
- ✅ **Optional metadata** → Name/email (individuals) or enterprise key + DNS (professionals).  
- ✅ **HTML certificate** → Public, tamper-proof proof file for audits.  

For **Professionals**:  
- 🔑 **Enterprise private key** (issued by DigitalMeve).  
- 🌐 **DNS binding** → Confirms organization’s ownership.  
- 🏷 **Branded watermark** (optional).  

---

## 4. Privacy by Design
- Files never leave the device.  
- Certificates are lightweight (KBs), no central storage required.  
- No accounts required for Free tier.  
- Paid users: only minimal metadata stored in the certificate itself.  

---

## 5. Professional & Enterprise Security
- Enterprises receive a **unique private key** to sign certificates.  
- DigitalMeve ensures **key issuance, revocation, and rotation policies**.  
- DNS `.well-known/meve.json` binding confirms organizational identity.  
- Certificates include **organization name + domain**, preventing impersonation.  

---

## 6. Payment Security
DigitalMeve uses **Stripe** as its global payment processor.  
Compliance with:  
- **PCI DSS** (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard).  
- **PSD2** (EU Strong Customer Authentication).  
- **Global anti-fraud protection** (3D Secure, chargeback management).  
- Refund policies aligned with **international e-commerce standards**.  

---

## 7. Compliance
DigitalMeve aligns with:  
- **GDPR** (EU General Data Protection Regulation).  
- **CCPA** (California Consumer Privacy Act).  
- **ISO 27001** (Information Security best practices).  
- **SOC 2 principles** (availability, integrity, confidentiality).  
- Roadmap includes:  
  - **Post-quantum cryptography** readiness.  
  - **Blockchain anchoring** for high-value certifications.  

---

## 8. Future Security Roadmap
- 🔐 **Post-quantum algorithms** (Kyber, Dilithium) to resist quantum attacks.  
- ⛓ **Optional blockchain anchors** for high-value enterprise records.  
- 🕵️ **AI-based fraud detection** on verification patterns.  
- 📊 **Enterprise audit logs** (tamper-proof).  

---

## 9. Responsible Disclosure
DigitalMeve welcomes security research.  
- Issues can be reported via **[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)**.  
- Coordinated disclosure principles apply.  
- Researchers acting in good faith are protected from legal action.  

---

## 🔒 Summary
DigitalMeve combines **visible + invisible proofs, cryptographic hashes, private keys, and DNS binding** into a **layered security model**.  
This ensures that certified files remain **globally verifiable, private, and tamper-proof**, making DigitalMeve a **new global standard for digital trust**.
