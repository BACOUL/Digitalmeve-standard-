# DigitalMeve Security Model

DigitalMeve is designed as a **global trust layer** for file certification and verification.  
Security, privacy, and compliance are not features — they are the foundation of the system.  
This document outlines the **threat model, cryptographic design, operational safeguards, and compliance framework**.

---

## 1. Principles

1. **Privacy First**  
   - Files never leave the user’s device during certification.  
   - All hashing and watermark embedding happens locally in the browser.  

2. **Zero Trust Architecture**  
   - No central storage of certified files.  
   - Only certificates and metadata are public/verifiable.  

3. **Transparency**  
   - Algorithms are documented and auditable.  
   - Certificates are simple, portable, and human-readable.  

4. **Global Compliance**  
   - Follows **GDPR**, **CCPA**, **PCI-DSS**, and international standards for data and payments.  
   - Adaptable to local regulatory requirements.

## 2. Threat Model

### 2.1 Attacker Goals
- Forge a certificate.  
- Modify a file without detection.  
- Impersonate a professional/company.  
- Exploit billing or payment weaknesses.  
- Leak user personal data.  

### 2.2 Protection Strategy
- **Cryptographic proofs**: SHA-256 fingerprints, invisible DigitalMeve markers, optional enterprise patches.  
- **Private keys for professionals**: enterprise signing with DNS binding.  
- **Browser-only hashing**: eliminates file exfiltration.  
- **Watermark visible + hidden markers**: tamper-proof dual layer.  
- **Payment isolation via Stripe**: no card data stored by DigitalMeve.  

---

## 3. Cryptographic Design

- **Hash Function:** SHA-256 (NIST-approved, widely audited).  
- **Invisible Proof:**  
  - Embedded SHA-256 fingerprint in file metadata layer.  
  - Invisible DigitalMeve signature embedded as secondary marker.  
- **Visible Proof:**  
  - Watermark with truncated SHA-256 visible on document.  
- **Professional Keys:**  
  - Each pro account receives a **private signing key**.  
  - Certificates are signed with company reference + DNS proof.  
- **Longevity:**  
  - Certificates remain valid across formats and decades (hashes are future-proof).

## 4. User Data Protection

- **No file storage.** DigitalMeve never hosts user files.  
- **Minimal data collection.** Only required billing data (via Stripe).  
- **Encryption in transit.** TLS 1.3 enforced across all communications.  
- **Encryption at rest.** Metadata and certificates stored encrypted (AES-256).  
- **Data deletion.** Users can request full erasure (GDPR compliance).  
- **Anonymity option.** Free users and some individual plans operate without identity linking.  

---

## 5. Payment Security

- **Processor:** Stripe (PCI-DSS Level 1 certified).  
- **Tokenization:** No credit card data touches DigitalMeve servers.  
- **Strong Customer Authentication (SCA):** Supported in EU.  
- **Localized Compliance:** VAT/GST/sales tax handled automatically.  
- **Refund policy:** Transparent, aligned with EU and US directives.  

---

## 6. Governance & Compliance

- **GDPR:** Data minimization, explicit consent, right to be forgotten.  
- **CCPA:** Right to access, deletion, and opt-out for California users.  
- **SOC 2 (planned):** For enterprise-level clients requiring auditability.  
- **ISO 27001 alignment:** Security management processes follow ISO best practices.  
- **Auditability:** Cryptographic proofs are verifiable by third parties.  

---

## 7. Operational Security

- **Infrastructure:**  
  - Hosting on globally distributed, secure providers.  
  - DDoS mitigation in place.  
- **Access Control:**  
  - Role-based access with MFA.  
  - Strict separation of duties.  
- **Monitoring:**  
  - Continuous security monitoring.  
  - Incident response plan aligned with NIST CSF.  
- **Backups:**  
  - Daily encrypted backups of metadata and certificates.  
  - No user file backups (as files are never stored).  

---

## 8. Advanced Protections

- **For Professionals:**  
  - Private key management with rotation policies.  
  - DNS-based domain verification.  
  - Enterprise watermark + invisible patch.  
- **For Individuals (Paid):**  
  - Certificate embeds certifier name or email.  
  - Personal signature included.  
- **For Free Users:**  
  - Anonymous certificate, watermark only.

## 9. Risk Mitigations

| Risk                        | Mitigation                                               |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| File tampering              | SHA-256 + invisible marker + visible watermark           |
| Certificate forgery         | Professional keys + DNS binding                          |
| Data leaks                  | No storage + encryption + minimal data collection        |
| Payment fraud               | Stripe PCI-DSS Level 1 + SCA                             |
| Insider threats             | RBAC + MFA + limited access                              |
| Long-term validity          | Open standard, auditable certificates                    |
