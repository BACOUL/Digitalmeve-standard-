## 1. Introduction

DigitalMeve defines a global, privacy-first standard for invisible proof of authenticity.  
It allows individuals and organizations to certify any digital file (documents, images, PDFs, contracts, artworks, invoices, etc.) **without central storage** and with **instant verification anywhere**.

The standard balances three critical pillars:

- **Trust** → Files carry invisible cryptographic proofs.
- **Privacy** → Processing happens fully on the user’s device.
- **Universality** → Certificates are readable and verifiable across platforms and time.
