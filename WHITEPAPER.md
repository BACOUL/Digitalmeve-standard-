# DigitalMeve Whitepaper

## 1. Introduction

In todayâ€™s digital ecosystem, authenticity is under constant threat.  
Fake invoices, forged diplomas, tampered contracts, and counterfeit artworks circulate at an unprecedented scale.  
Trust, once inherent in physical signatures and official stamps, is now fragile in the digital world.

**DigitalMeve** introduces a new paradigm:  
ðŸ‘‰ Every file can become its own certificate of authenticity.  
Invisible, secure, and verifiable anywhere â€” without central storage or exposure of private data.

## 2. The Problem

- **Rising fraud**: Digital forgeries in legal, financial, and creative industries are growing exponentially.  
- **Centralized solutions**: Most current certification systems rely on servers or intermediaries, making them fragile, opaque, and costly.  
- **Lack of universality**: Existing standards (PDF signing, proprietary DRM, blockchain anchoring) are fragmented, complex, and not universally accessible.  
- **Barrier for individuals**: Creators, freelancers, and small businesses lack affordable, simple tools for protecting their work.

## 3. The DigitalMeve Solution

DigitalMeve introduces the **.MEVE Standard**, a universal, privacy-first, and auditable method for certifying any file.

- **Visible watermark**: Each certified document carries a subtle visible mark of authenticity.  
- **Invisible fingerprint**: A SHA-256 hash is invisibly embedded inside the file.  
- **DigitalMeve invisible key**: Proprietary invisible marker that binds the file to the certificate.  
- **User identity integration**:  
  - For **individuals**: Paid plans embed the name or email of the certifier in the certificate.  
  - For **professionals**: Private keys are issued to allow certification under the company name, reinforced with DNS binding.

The result: **tamper-evident digital files that remain self-verifiable, without external databases**.
